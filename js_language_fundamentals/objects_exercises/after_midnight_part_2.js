/*
As seen in the previous exercise, the time of day can be represented as
the number of minutes before or after midnight. If the number of minutes is
 positive, the time is after midnight. If the number of minutes is negative, the time is before midnight.

The two functions below do the reverse of the previous exercise. They
 take a 24-hour time argument and return the number of minutes before or after
 midnight, respectively. Both functions should return a value between 0 and 1439 (inclusive).
 Refactor the functions using the Date object.
